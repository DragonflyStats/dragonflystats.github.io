### Research Software Engineering

#### Research Software Engineering

* Research software engineering is the use of software engineering practices in research applications. 

* The term was proposed in a research paper in 2010 in response to an empirical survey on tools used for software development in research projects. 

* It started to be used in United Kingdom in 2012, when it was needed to define the type of software development needed in research. 

* This focuses on reproducibility, reusability, and accuracy of data analysis and applications created for research.
