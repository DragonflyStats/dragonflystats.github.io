In this module, you will be able to map out your joins and be able to highlight the level of detail needed for different kinds of questions. You will be able to practice answering data questions, which should help you feel ready to get asked a whole slough of questions, vague questions, ambiguous questions, or even poorly worded questions. Finally, you will develop a strategy for answering all those questions using data.
