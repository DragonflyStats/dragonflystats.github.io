In this module, you will identify the key characteristics of data lakes, data warehouses, and lakehouses. Lakehouses combine the scalability and low-cost storage of data lakes with the speed and ACID transactional guarantees of data warehouses. You will build a production grade lakehouse by combining Spark with the open-source project, Delta Lake. Whoever said time travel isn't possible hasn't been to a lakehouse!
