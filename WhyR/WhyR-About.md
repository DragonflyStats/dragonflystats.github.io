Why R? is a Polish R Foundation - but with collaborators in Ireland, UK and Netherlands to name a few places.
There is a strong relationship with Africa R Community (https://africa-r.org/) which actually got started at the H2O world event
As a non-profit foundation, Why R? runs a conference in Poland each year. This years conference will take place in a virtual mode in a fortnight.
The proceeds of which have been used to sponsor events all over Africa and Europe - SatRdays Abidjan, Saturdays Cardiff and SatRdays Jo'Burg being recent ones. Here is a write-up about the Forwards project that Why R? funded earlier this year: https://forwards.github.io/blog/2020/05/25/southern-africa-project-2020/

The webinar series is the main activity of Why R? during the COVID crisis. We have been running them since April 2020.
We look for all sorts of topics ( I am also asking someone for a fisheries talks) and all sort of locations ( including Ascension Island)

During the last 4 years of our activity we managed to organize +40 on-site meetups for 50-100 participants each, on-site 4 days long conference for ~400 participants each, hackathons and online webinars (20k views in total). Together, at Why R? Foundation, we developed a ‘’Supporting grant for Women in Data Science’’ (http://whyr.pl/foundation/supporting-grant/) that aims to support women in data science in their early stages of their career. The grant has been available for 3 years. 

Not only have we organized events in Europe, but we have also financially supported on-site events in Asia (Armenia) and Africa (Nigeria, Uganda, Cote D’Ivoire, Eswatini, Botswana and South Africa), using the profits made from our conference. The list of events can be found here http://whyr.pl/foundation/events/ 

Most of the events target professional participants and enable them to grow their statistics and data science skill set, however we also managed to organize workshops for newcomers willing to start their career in statistics and data analysis. 
We intend to support more R community events all around the world in the future.
