Longfield's passion for entomology took her on numerous expeditions around the world, including South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. She collected and identified many new species of dragonflies and butterflies². Her book, *The Dragonflies of the British Isles*, published in 1937, became a standard reference in the field¹².

She also worked as a research associate at the Natural History Museum in London, where she was responsible for the dragonfly collection¹. Longfield's contributions to entomology and her adventurous spirit made her a significant figure in the scientific community.
