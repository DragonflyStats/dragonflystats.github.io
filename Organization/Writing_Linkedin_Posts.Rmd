### LinkedIn Post Protocol: Structure, Keywords, and Visuals

#### 1. Lead with Key Details (First 3–4 Lines)
LinkedIn collapses long posts after ~3 lines on mobile and ~4 on desktop. To maximize visibility:

- **Start with the most important info**: event name, announcement, achievement, or call to action.
- Use **bold phrasing**, line breaks, or formatting to draw attention.
- Example:

```
Excited to announce our upcoming community showcase: "Data & Drones: Visualizing the Future"!
November 12 | Dublin | Hosted by Why R? Foundation
```

#### 2. Use Strategic Keywords
LinkedIn’s algorithm surfaces posts based on relevance and engagement. To optimize reach:

- Include **keywords** related to your domain, audience, and theme (e.g., “open-source”, “data visualization”, “community outreach”, “R programming”, “drone mapping”).
- Mention **organizations, tools, or formats** (e.g., “Why R?”, “Copilot”, “ggplot2”, “Shiny”, “pet portraits for outreach”).
- Avoid keyword stuffing — 3–5 well-placed terms are ideal.

#### 3. Image Guidelines
Visuals dramatically increase engagement. Follow these specs:

- **Aspect ratio**: Prefer **landscape (3:2)** — e.g., 1500×1000 px or 1200×800 px.
- Avoid **portrait orientation** (e.g., 2:3 or 9:16), which LinkedIn penalizes for taking up too much vertical space.
- Use **high-resolution images** with clear focal points and minimal text overlay.

#### 4. Alt Text for Accessibility and SEO
Always include **alt text** when uploading images:

- Use **Copilot** or another tool to generate up to **1000 characters** of descriptive alt text.
- Include:
  - What’s visually depicted (e.g., “A drone hovering over a coastal landscape with data overlays”)
  - Context (e.g., “Captured during the Why R? Foundation’s outreach event on environmental mapping”)
  - 2–3 relevant keywords (e.g., “drone mapping”, “community data”, “open-source visualization”)

#### 5. Writing Tools and Workflow
- Use **Microsoft Copilot** to draft, refine, and optimize your post.
- Consider writing in **Word or Notepad first**, then pasting into LinkedIn to avoid formatting glitches.
- Review your post for:
  - Line breaks and spacing
  - Keyword placement
  - Image alignment and alt text

#### Sample LinkedIn Post Template

```
Just wrapped up our latest outreach project: "Data & Drones: Mapping Community Stories"!

Hosted by Why R? Foundation in Dublin, this initiative brought together open-source advocates, drone pilots, and data artists to visualize local narratives through aerial mapping and R-powered diagrams.

From pet portraits to environmental overlays, we explored how playful visuals and comparative diagrams can foster identity and engagement.

Tools used: ggplot2, Copilot, Shiny, and custom drone telemetry pipelines.
