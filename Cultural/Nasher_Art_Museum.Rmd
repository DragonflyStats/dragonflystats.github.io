The **Nasher Museum of Art** at Duke University in Durham, NC, is a leading institution for contemporary and global art, with a collection of over 13,000 works. The museum is dedicated to amplifying historically marginalized voices, particularly through bold, socially engaged contemporary pieces.

Among its standout artists is **Jaune Quick-to-See Smith**, a renowned Native American painter and printmaker. Her work, including *Fifty Shades of White*, addresses colonialism and cultural erasure with layered symbolism and wit. Smith's presence reflects the Nasher's commitment to Indigenous perspectives.

The museum also features major works like **Archibald Motley’s** vibrant *Hot Rhythm* (1961), a jazz-age portrait of African American nightlife. Donated by Motley’s heirs, it anchors the **Art of the United States Gallery** and was the centerpiece of the 2014 exhibition *Archibald Motley: Jazz Age Modernist*.

Other acclaimed artists represented include:

- **Barkley L. Hendricks** – Portraits celebrating Black identity and style
- **Nina Chanel Abney** – Pop-art inspired paintings confronting race and politics
- **Christian Marclay** – *Telephones*, a surreal video montage of film dialogues
- **Wangechi Mutu** – Fantastical collages exploring femininity and African identity
- **Amy Sherald** – Stylized portraits, including her iconic work of Michelle Obama

The museum actively curates works by African American artists who have shaped contemporary art and challenged dominant narratives:

- **Kerry James Marshall** – Monumental depictions of Black life and history  
- **Kara Walker** – Silhouettes exposing race, gender, and power  
- **Hank Willis Thomas** – Media remixing to question systemic injustice  
- **Lorna Simpson** – Poetic conceptual photography  
- **Mickalene Thomas** – Rhinestone-studded portraits of Black femininity  
- **Theaster Gates** – Social sculpture and community-based installations  

The Nasher’s architecture, designed by Rafael Viñoly, offers a stunning backdrop for exhibitions focused on environmental justice, cultural memory, and identity. Whether showcasing activism, introspection, or fantasy, the museum invites visitors into a lively and essential cultural dialogue.
