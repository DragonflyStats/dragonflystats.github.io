2. **Dan Leno**: Born George Wild Galvin, Dan Leno was of Irish descent and became one of the most popular comedians and performers in the British music hall⁵.

3. **Vesta Tilley**: Born Matilda Alice Powles, she was of Irish descent and known for her male impersonations, becoming one of the highest-paid performers of her era⁵.

4. **Harry Lauder**: Although Scottish, Harry Lauder had Irish ancestry and was a beloved music hall performer known for his comedic songs and performances⁵.
