In this talk, I will be discussing my career path as a data scientist in the fields of food science, life science, forestry and agriculture, and how I foresee 
how this working in the sector will evolve into the future. I will draw attention to some skillsets that I have found to be very useful and under-appreciated, and give 
some recommendations to career-young data scientists who are embarking on a similar career.
Key topics include Statistical Anaylsis, Statistical Process Control, Data Engineering, Databases and Dashboard tools
