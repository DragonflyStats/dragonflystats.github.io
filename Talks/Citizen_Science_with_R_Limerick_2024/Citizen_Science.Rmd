### What is citizen science?
Citizen science is data collection by members of the public to help answer research questions. Having a strong recording community is essential to citizen science.

<i>We are extremely grateful for our volunteers. One of the benefits of citizen science is that we are able to collect data nationwide over long periods of times.</i> 
<i>For example, the Irish Butterfly Monitoring Scheme began in 2008 and it simply would not be possible without citizen science to generate such a large dataset across Ireland on our butterfly populations.</i>
