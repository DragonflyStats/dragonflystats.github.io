### Biography

<h3>Open Source Technology Communities</h3>

In recent years, I’ve been part of the organizing teams for several major PyData conferences, including PyData London 2025, PyData NYC 2024, and ongoing support for PyData Global. My contributions typically focus on social media strategy, corporate outreach, speaker recruitment, CFP review, and session chairing.

I also assisted with the organization of PyData Berlin 2025, specifically in retrieving social media assets and advising on best practices for outreach and engagement.

Earlier in my journey, I founded PyData Dublin / PyData Ireland, helping establish a vibrant local community. While I’ve since stepped back from day-to-day organizational duties, the initiative continues to thrive.

I served on the Board of Python Ireland, acting as Conference Lead for PyCon Ireland (2015–2019) and PyCon Limerick (2019–2020). Over the past decade, I’ve also been actively involved in the R and Julia communities, contributing to events, outreach, and cross-community collaboration.

### Research Software Engineering

#### Research Software Engineering

* Research software engineering is the use of software engineering practices in research applications. 

* The term was proposed in a research paper in 2010 in response to an empirical survey on tools used for software development in research projects. 

* It started to be used in United Kingdom in 2012, when it was needed to define the type of software development needed in research. 

* This focuses on reproducibility, reusability, and accuracy of data analysis and applications created for research.
