####Description

The scatter3d function uses the rgl package to draw 3D scatterplots with various regression
surfaces. The function Identify3d allows you to label points interactively with the mouse: Press
the right mouse button (on a two-button mouse) or the centre button (on a three-button mouse), drag
a rectangle around the points to be identified, and release the button. Repeat this procedure for each
point or set of "nearby" points to be identified. To exit from point-identification mode, click the
right (or centre) button in an empty region of the plot.

####Usage

offset = ((100/length(x))^(1/3)) * 0.02)

####Arguments

formula "model" formula, of the form y ~ x + z or to plot by groups y ~ x + z | g,
where g evaluates to a factor or other variable dividing the data into groups.
data data frame within which to evaluate the formula.
subset expression defining a subset of observations.

* x variable for horizontal axis.
* y variable for vertical axis (response).
* z variable for out-of-screen axis.
* xlab, ylab, zlab axis labels.
* axis.scales if TRUE, label the values of the ends of the axes. Note: For Identify3d to work
properly, the value of this argument must be the same as in scatter3d.
axis.ticks if TRUE, print interior axis-"tick" labels; the default is FALSE. (The code for this
option was provided by David Winsemius.)
revolutions number of full revolutions of the display.

* `` bg.col``:  background colour; one of "white", "black".
* axis.col colours for axes; if axis.scales is FALSE, then the second colour is used for all three axes.
* surface.col vector of colours for regression planes, used in the order specified by fit; for multi-group plots, the colours are used for the regression surfaces and points in the several groups.
* surface.alpha transparency of regression surfaces, from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (opaque);
default is 0.5.
neg.res.col, pos.res.col
colours for lines representing negative and positive residuals.
square.col colour to use to plot squared residuals.
* ``point.col``: colour of points.
text.col colour of axis labels.
grid.col colour of grid lines on the regression surface(s).
fogtype type of fog effect; one of "exp2", "linear", "exp", "none".
residuals plot residuals if TRUE; if residuals="squares", then the squared residuals are
shown as squares (using code adapted from Richard Heiberger). Residuals are
available only when there is one surface plotted.
surface plot surface(s) (TRUE or FALSE).
fill fill the plotted surface(s) with colour (TRUE or FALSE).
grid plot grid lines on the regression surface(s) (TRUE or FALSE).
grid.lines number of lines (default, 26) forming the grid, in each of the x and z directions.
112 scatter3d
df.smooth degrees of freedom for the two-dimensional smooth regression surface; if NULL
(the default), the gam function will select the degrees of freedom for a smoothing
spline by generalized cross-validation; if a positive number, a fixed regression
spline will be fit with the specified degrees of freedom.
df.additive degrees of freedom for each explanatory variable in an additive regression; if
NULL (the default), the gam function will select degrees of freedom for the smoothing
splines by generalized cross-validation; if a positive number or a vector of
two positive numbers, fixed regression splines will be fit with the specified degrees
of freedom for each term.
* ``sphere.size``:  general size of spheres representing points; the actual size is dependent on the
number of observations.
radius relative radii of the spheres representing the points. This is normally a vector
of the same length as the variables giving the coordinates of the points, and for
the formula method, that must be the case or the argument may be omitted, in
which case spheres are the same size; for the default method, the default for
the argument, 1, produces spheres all of the same size. The radii are scaled so
that their median is 1.
threshold if the actual size of the spheres is less than the threshold, points are plotted
instead.
speed relative speed of revolution of the plot.
fov field of view (in degrees); controls degree of perspective.
fit one or more of "linear", "quadratic", "smooth", "additive"; to display
fitted surface(s); partial matching is supported - e.g., c("lin", "quad").
groups if NULL (the default), no groups are defined; if a factor, a different surface or
set of surfaces is plotted for each level of the factor; in this event, the colours
in surface.col are used successively for the points, surfaces, and residuals
corresponding to each level of the factor.
parallel when plotting surfaces by groups, should the surfaces be constrained to be parallel?
A logical value, with default TRUE.
ellipsoid plot concentration ellipsoid(s) (TRUE or FALSE).
level expected proportion of bivariate-normal observations included in the concentration
ellipsoid(s); default is 0.5.
ellipsoid.alpha
transparency of ellipsoids, from 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (opaque); default
is 0.1.
id FALSE, TRUE, or a list controlling point identification, similar to showLabels for
2D plots (see Details
).
model.summary print summary or summaries of the model(s) fit (TRUE or FALSE). scatter3d
rescales the three variables internally to fit in the unit cube; this rescaling will
affect regression coefficients.
labels text labels for the points, one for each point; defaults to the observation indices.
col colours for the point labels, given by group. There must be at least as many
colours as groups; if there are no groups, the first colour is used. Normally, the
colours would correspond to the surface.col argument to scatter3d.
scatter3d 113
offset vertical displacement for point labels (to avoid overplotting the points).
... arguments to be passed down.

####Details

The id argument to scatter3d can be FALSE, TRUE (in which case 2 points will be identified
according to their Mahalanobis distances from the center of the data), or a list containing any or all
of the following elements:
method if "mahal" (the default), relatively extreme points are identified automatically according
to their Mahalanobis distances from the centroid (point of means); if "identify", points
are identified interactively by right-clicking and dragging a box around them; right-click in
an empty area to exit from interactive-point-identification mode; if "xz", identify extreme
points in the predictor plane; if "y", identify unusual values of the response; if "xyz" identify
unusual values of an variable; if "none", no point identification. See showLabels for more
information.
n Number of relatively extreme points to identify automatically (default, 2, unless method="identify",
in which case identification continues until the user exits).
labels text labels for the points, one for each point; in the default method defaults to the observation
indices, in the formula method to the row names of the data.
offset vertical displacement for point labels (to avoid overplotting the points).
Value
scatter3d does not return a useful value; it is used for its side-effect of creating a 3D scatterplot.
Identify3d returns the labels of the identified points.
Note
You have to install the rgl package to produce 3D plots. On a Macintosh (but not on Windows or
Linux), you may also need to install the X11 windowing system. Go to https://www.xquartz.
org/ and click on the link for XQuartz. Double-click on the downloaded disk-image file, and
then double-click on XQuartz.pkg to start the installer. You may take all of the defaults in the
installation. After XQuartz is installed, you should restart your Macintosh.
