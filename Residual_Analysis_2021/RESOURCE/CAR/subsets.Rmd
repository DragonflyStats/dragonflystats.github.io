subsets Plot Output from regsubsets Function in leaps package

####Description

The regsubsets function in the leaps package finds optimal subsets of predictors based on some
criterion statistic. This function plots a measure of fit against subset size.

####Usage
<pre><code>

subsets(object, ...)
## S3 method for class 'regsubsets'
subsets(object,
names=abbreviate(object$xnames, minlength = abbrev),
abbrev=1, min.size=1, max.size=length(names),
legend="interactive",
statistic=c("bic", "cp", "adjr2", "rsq", "rss"),
las=par('las'), cex.subsets=1, ...)
subsets 131

</code></pre>

####Arguments

* object a regsubsets object produced by the regsubsets function in the leaps package.
* names a vector of (short) names for the predictors, excluding the regression intercept, if one is present; if missing, these are derived from the predictor names in object.
* abbrev minimum number of characters to use in abbreviating predictor names.
* min.size minimum size subset to plot; default is 1.
* max.size maximum size subset to plot; default is number of predictors.
* legend If not FALSE, in which case the legend is suppressed, the coordinates at which to place a legend of the abbreviated predictor names on the plot, in a form recognized
by the legend function. If "interactive", the legend is placed on the plot interactively with the mouse. By expanding the left or right plot margin,
you can place the legend in the margin, if you wish (see par).
* statistic statistic to plot for each predictor subset; one of: "bic", Bayes Information Criterion; "cp", Mallowsâ€™s Cp; "adjr2", R2 adjusted for degrees of freedom;
"rsq", unadjusted R2; "rss", residual sum of squares.
* las if 0, ticks labels are drawn parallel to the axis; set to 1 for horizontal labels (see
par).
cex.subsets can be used to change the relative size of the characters used to plot the regression
subsets; default is 1.
... arguments to be passed down to subsets.regsubsets and plot.
Value
NULL if the legend is TRUE; otherwise a data frame with the legend.
