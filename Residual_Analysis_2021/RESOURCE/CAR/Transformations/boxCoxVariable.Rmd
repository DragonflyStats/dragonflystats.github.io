boxCoxVariable Constructed Variable for Box-Cox Transformation

####Description

Computes a constructed variable for the Box-Cox transformation of the response variable in a linear
model.

####Usage
<pre><code>

boxCoxVariable(y)

</code></pre>

####Arguments

y response variable.
Boxplot 21

####Details

The constructed variable is defined as y[log(y=ey) ?? 1], where ey is the geometric mean of y.
The constructed variable is meant to be added to the right-hand-side of the linear model. The t-test
for the coefficient of the constructed variable is an approximate score test for whether a transformation
is required.
If b is the coefficient of the constructed variable, then an estimate of the normalizing power transformation
based on the score statistic is 1 ?? b. An added-variable plot for the constructed variable
shows leverage and influence on the decision to transform y.
Value
a numeric vector of the same length as y.
