``recode``: Recode a Variable

#### Description

Recodes a numeric vector, character vector, or factor according to simple recode specifications.
Recode is an alias for recode that avoids name clashes with packages, such as Hmisc, that have a recode function.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

recode(var, recodes, as.factor, as.numeric=TRUE, levels)
Recode(...)

</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``var``: numeric vector, character vector, or factor.
* ``recodes``: character string of recode specifications: see below.
* ``as.factor``: return a factor; default is TRUE if var is a factor, FALSE otherwise.
* ``as.numeric``: if TRUE (the default), and ``as.factor`` is FALSE, then the result will be coerced to
* ``numeric``: if all values in the result are numeralsâ€”i.e., represent numbers.
* ``levels``: an optional argument specifying the order of the levels in the returned factor; the default is to use the sort order of the level names.
* ``...``: arguments to be passed to recode.


#### Examples

```{r}

x<-rep(1:3,3)
x
## [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
recode(x, "c(1,2)='A';
else='B'")
## [1] "A" "A" "B" "A" "A" "B" "A" "A" "B"
Recode(x, "1:2='A'; 3='B'")
## [1] "A" "A" "B" "A" "A" "B" "A" "A" "B"
```

#### Details

Recode specifications appear in a character string, separated by semicolons (see the examples below),
of the form input=output. If an input value satisfies more than one specification, then the first (from left to right) applies. If no specification is satisfied, then the input value is carried over to the result. NA is allowed on input and output. Several recode specifications are supported:
single value For example, 0=NA.
vector of values For example, c(7,8,9)='high'.
range of values For example, 7:9='C'. The special values lo and hi may appear in a range. For example, lo:10=1. Note: : is not the R sequence operator. In addition you may not use :
with the collect operator, so for example c(1, 3, 5:7) will cause an error.
else everything that does not fit a previous specification. For example, else=NA. Note that else matches all otherwise unspecified values on input, including NA.
If all of the output values are numeric, and if as.factor is FALSE, then a numeric result is returned;
if var is a factor, then by default so is the result.

#### Value
a recoded vector of the same length as var.
