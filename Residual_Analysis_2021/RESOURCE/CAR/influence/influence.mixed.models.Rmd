Influence Diagnostics for Mixed-Effects Models

####Description

These functions compute deletion influence diagnostics for linear mixed-effects models fit by lmer
in the lme4 package and lme in the nlme package and for generalized linear mixed-effects models fit
by glmer in the lme4 package. The main functions are methods for the influence generic function.
Other functions are provided for computing dfbeta, dfbetas, cooks.distance, and influence
on variance-covariance components based on the objects computed by influence.merMod and
influence.lme.

####Usage
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'merMod'
influence(model, groups, data, maxfun=1000, ...)
## S3 method for class 'lme'
influence(model, groups, data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.merMod'
cooks.distance(model, ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.lme'
cooks.distance(model, ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.merMod'
dfbeta(model, which = c("fixed", "var.cov"), ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.lme'
dfbeta(model, which = c("fixed", "var.cov"), ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.merMod'
dfbetas(model, ...)
## S3 method for class 'influence.lme'
dfbetas(model, ...)

</code></pre>

####Arguments

model in the case of influence.merMod or influence.lme, a model of class "merMod"
or "lme"; in the case of cooks.distance, dfbeta, or dfbetas, an object returned
by influence.merMod or influence.lme.
groups a character vector containing the name of a grouping factor or names of grouping
factors; if more than one name is supplied, then groups are defined by all
combinations of levels of the grouping factors that appear in the data. If omitted,
then each individual row of the data matrix is treated as a "group" to be
deleted in turn.
* ``data  `` : an optional data frame with the data to which model was fit; influence.merMod
can usually reconstruct the data, and influence.lme can access the data unless
keep.data=FALSE was specified in the call to lme, so itâ€™s usually unnecessary
to supply the data argument.
influence.mixed.models 63
maxfun The maximum number of function evaluations (for influence.merMod) to perform
after deleting each group; the defaults are large enough so that the iterations
will typically continue to convergence. Setting to maxfun=20 for an lmer model
or 100 for a glmer model will typically produce a faster reasonable approximation.
An even smaller value can be used if interest is only in influence on the
fixed effects.
which if "fixed.effects" (the default), return influence on the fixed effects; if "var.cov",
return influence on the variance-covariance components.
... ignored.

####Details

influence.merMod and influence.lme start with the estimated variance-covariance components
from model and then refit the model omitting each group in turn, not necessarily iterating to completion.
For example, maxfun=20 takes up to 20 function evaluations step away from the ML or
REML solution for the full data, which usually provides decent approximations to the fully iterated
estimates.
The other functions are methods for the dfbeta, dfbetas, and cooks.distance generics, to be applied
to the "influence.merMod" or "influence.lme" object produced by the influence function;
the dfbeta methods can also return influence on the variance-covariance components.
Value
influence.merMod and influence.lme return objects of class "influence.merMod" and "influence.lme"
respectively, each of which contains the following elements:
"fixed.effects" the estimated fixed effects for the model.
"fixed.effects[-groups]" a matrix with columns corresponding to the fixed-effects coefficients
and rows corresponding to groups, giving the estimated fixed effects with each group deleted
in turn; groups is formed from the name(s) of the grouping factor(s).
"var.cov.comps" the estimated variance-covariance parameters for the model.
"var.cov.comps[-groups]" a matrix with the estimated covariance parameters (in columns) with
each group deleted in turn.
"vcov" The estimated covariance matrix of the fixed-effects coefficients.
"vcov[-groups]" a list each of whose elements is the estimated covariance matrix of the fixedeffects
coefficients with one group deleted.
"groups" a character vector giving the names of the grouping factors.
"deleted" the possibly composite grouping factor, each of whose elements is deleted in turn.
"converged" for influence.merMod, a logical vector indicating whether the computation converged
for each group.
"function.evals" for influence.merMod, a vector of the number of function evaluations performed
for each group.
For plotting "influence.merMod" and "influence.lme" objects, see infIndexPlot.
