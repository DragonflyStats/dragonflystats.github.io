```




####Description

symbox first transforms x to each of a series of selected powers, with each transformation standardized
to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The results are then displayed side-by-side in boxplots,
permiting a visual assessment of which power makes the distribution reasonably symmetric.

####Usage
<pre><code>

symbox(x, ...)
## S3 method for class 'formula'
symbox(formula, data=NULL, subset, na.action=NULL, ylab, ...)
## Default S3 method:
symbox(x, powers = c(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1), start,
trans=bcPower, xlab="Powers", ylab, ...)

</code></pre>

####Arguments

x a numeric vector.
formula a one-sided formula specifying a single numeric variable.
data, subset, na.action
as for statistical modeling functions (see, e.g., lm).
xlab, ylab axis labels; if ylab is missing, a label will be supplied.
powers a vector of selected powers to which x is to be raised. For meaningful comparison
of powers, 1 should be included in the vector of powers.
start a constant to be added to x. If start is missing and trans is bcPower (the
default) or bcnPower, then a start will be automatically generated if there are
zero or negative values in x, and a warning will be printed; the auto-generated
start is the absolute value of the minimum x plus 1 percent of the range of x.
trans a transformation function whose first argument is a numeric vector and whose
second argument is a transformation parameter, given by the powers argument;
the default is bcPower, and another possibility is yjPower. bcnPower may also
be used, in which case the gamma parameter is set to the value of start.
... arguments to be passed down.



####Examples

```{r}
symbox(~ income, data=Prestige)
```
Value
as returned by boxplot.
